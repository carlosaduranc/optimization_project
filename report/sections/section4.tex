\section{Model Predictive Control}
\label{sec:mpc}
Following the identification of the model done in section \ref{sec:trajectory_optimization}, an optimal control strategy was developed for the deployment of the zone heating by means of model predictive control (MPC). First, a primal optimal problem was developed for the MPC application which resulted in a significant decrease in energy consumption and therefore energy costs. Nevertheless, due to the constraint nature of primal optimal problems, the robustness of the control was a matter of concern. Due to this, a second approach following a lagrangian problem statement was developed. This allowed for the relaxation of the constraints, leading to a more robust control. The details pertaining both approaches are thoroughly explained in their corresponding subsections in the following.
